# 🌍 Real-Time Air Quality Index (AQI) Dashboard – India

## 📌 Project Overview
This project involves building an interactive Excel dashboard to analyze real-time air quality data across India. The dashboard transforms raw AQI data into meaningful visual insights related to pollution levels, geographic distribution, and pollutant trends.

## 🎯 Objectives
- Analyze state-wise and city-wise air pollution levels
- Identify the most polluted locations in India
- Compare average pollution levels by pollutant type
- Enable interactive data exploration using filters and slicers

## 🛠️ Tools & Technologies
- Microsoft Excel
- Pivot Tables
- Pivot Charts
- Slicers
- Map Visualization

## 📊 Dashboard Features
- State-wise and city-wise pollution distribution
- Top 10 most polluted cities visualization
- Pollutant-wise average AQI comparison
- Interactive slicers for city, state, and pollutant
- Geographic map-based analysis

## 📈 Key Insights
- Highlighted regions with consistently high pollution levels
- Identified dominant pollutants contributing to poor air quality
- Enabled quick comparison across cities and states
